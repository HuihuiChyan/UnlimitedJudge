It tells the story of an Indian-American family and their struggles with identity and cultural assimilation. The film was not nominated for any Academy Awards, so the statement that it is an Oscar-nominated film is incorrect.\n\nRegarding the second part of the statement, it is true that the screenwriter of \"The Namesake\" is the same person who wrote a 1991 romantic drama based on a screenplay by Sooni Taraporevala. The screenwriter in question is Sooni Taraporevala herself.
