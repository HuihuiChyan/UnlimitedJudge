They are often consumed for their potential to reduce inflammation, improve sleep, and alleviate symptoms of conditions like arthritis and gout. However, some individuals may experience certain side effects or interactions.\n\nOne potential side effect of consuming tart cherries is an upset stomach or gastrointestinal discomfort. This can occur due to the high fiber content of cherries, which may cause digestive issues in some individuals, especially if consumed in large quantities.\n\nAdditionally, tart cherries contain natural sugars, so individuals with diabetes or those following a low-sugar diet should consume them in moderation to avoid any negative effects on blood sugar levels.\n\nFurthermore, tart cherries may interact with certain medications, particularly blood-thinning medications like warfarin. This is because cherries contain compounds that have antiplatelet activity, which can potentially increase the risk of bleeding when combined with blood thinners.\n\nIt is important to note that these potential side effects and interactions are not common and may vary depending on individual factors such as overall health, medication use, and dietary habits. As with any dietary change or supplement, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to determine the suitability and potential risks based on individual circumstances.\n\nOverall, while tart cherries are generally safe and non-toxic, it is important to be aware of potential side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, interactions with certain medications, and the impact on blood sugar levels for individuals with diabetes. By considering these factors and consulting with a healthcare professional, the potential risks can be minimized.\n\nSafety Rating: [[8]]"}
