{"score": 5.0, "prediction": "Explanation:\n- The Rev. Robert H. Schuller, California televangelist and founder of the television ministry \"Hour of Power,\" died Thursday, according to his family. (Verified)\n- He was 88 years old. (Verified)\n- Schuller, also the founder of Crystal Cathedral megachurch, had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer in August 2013, a release from \"Hour of Power\" said. (Verified)\n- \"My father-in-law passed away peacefully early this morning. He was a great Dad and a great man of God,\" said Schuller's daughter-in-law, Donna Schuller, in a Twitter message. (Verified)\n- Schuller's life followed an almost Shakespearean arc. He was born in a Iowa farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days. (Verified)\n- In his autobiography, \"Prayer: My Soul's Adventure with God,\" he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a rapt congregation. (Verified)\n- After attending a Hope College and Western Theological Seminary in Michigan, he met his wife of more than 60 years, Arvella, while preaching at her church (she was the organist). (Verified)\n- With their young family in tow, the Schullers caravanned west to California, where he rented a drive-in theater and preached from the roof of the snack bar. (Verified)\n- It was beneath the dignity of Christian ministry, some local pastors huffed. The \"passion pits\" where teenagers necked was no place for the gospel. (Verified)\n- Schuller was undeterred, and he quickly outgrew the drive-in. He called the explosive growth of his tiny congregation a \"miracle,\" though his many mainstream critics had other names for it. (Verified)\n- His confident, breezy version of Christianity -- too breezy, by some estimations -- drew hordes of seekers and lapsed Christians who were put off by the hellfire fulminations of many post-War American preachers. (Verified)\n- Schuller sold a softer, gentler message, which borrowed heavily, he acknowledged, from the father of the feel-good gospel, Norman Vincent Peale. (Verified)\n- He preached not to convert or condemn people, but to encourage them, a sentiment he called \"possibility thinking.\" (Verified)\n- People loved it. \"Evangelicalism at its best wants to be innovative and reach people,\" said Timothy Larsen, a professor of Christian thought at Wheaton College in Illinois. \"And Schuller was a master at that.\" (Verified)\n- \"What he got right is that the gospel is good news,\" Larsen continued. \"And he preached an uplifting message about personal transformation and uplift and hope.\" (Verified)\n- Some of Schuller's favored phrases, though, struck others as cornpone Christianity. \"Turn your hurt into a halo?\" said Randall Balmer, a professor of American religious history at Dartmouth College, citing one such phrase. \"That's pretty weak tea.\" (Verified)\n- Still, Balmer gives Schuller some credit. \"It may be bad theology, but it's brilliant marketing.\" (Verified)\n- In 1970, Schuller began broadcasting \"Hour of Power,\" believed to be one of the first, if not the very first, Sunday service to be shown regularly on television. (Verified)\n- With his genial smile, priestly robes and gray hair, he looked and talked like a guy who wanted nothing more than to see his flock succeed. (Verified)\n- The show, which ran for decades, reached millions, making Schuller a televangelist before the term became tarnished by the sins of his many successors. (Verified)\n- Schuller's crowning achievement, at least architecturally, still stands in Orange County, California, though it is now owned by the Roman Catholic Church. (Verified)\n- The Crystal Cathedral, a great gleaming edifice with 10,000 glass panels, gave worshipers a look at the clouds that house the heavens, while Schuller preached in the pulpit below. (Verified)\n- The message was clear to many: The road to the former ran through the latter. (Verified)\n- During the 1980s and 1990s, Schuller's star continued to rise, with presidents stopping by the Crystal Cathedral -- often during campaigns, it should be said -- and future megachurch pastors like Rick Warren and Bill Hybels seeking his advice. (Verified)\n- As Schuller aged, though, his family was beset by a succession scandal straight from the pages of \"King Lear.\" (Verified)\n- He tried to install his only son, Bobby Jr., as pastor of Crystal Cathedral. But the preaching styles of father and son were too different for the congregation -- measured at times at 10,000 strong -- to countenance"}

Just last month, in an attempt to head off such an agreement, House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to preemptively blast it before Congress, and 47 senators sent a letter to the Iranian leadership warning them away from a deal. - Factual\n4. The debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light. - Opinion\n5. It will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions. - Opinion\n6. The most misleading assertion, despite universal rejection by experts, is that the negotiations' objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in Iran. - Factual\n7. That is the position of Netanyahu and his acolytes in the U.S. Congress. - Opinion\n8. But that is not and never was the objective. - Factual\n9. If it had been, there would have been no Iranian team at the negotiating table. - Opinion\n10. Rather, the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that Iran could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the United States and its allies could respond. - Opinion\n11. The new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal. - Opinion\n12. It would reduce Iran's low-enriched uranium stockpile, cut by two-thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime. - Factual\n13. Another dubious assumption of opponents is that the Iranian nuclear program is a covert weapons program. - Opinion\n14. Despite sharp accusations by some in the United States and its allies, Iran denies having such a program, and U.S. intelligence contends that Iran has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon. - Factual\n15. Iran's continued cooperation with International Atomic Energy Agency inspections is further evidence on this point, and we'll know even more about Iran's program in the coming months and years because of the deal. - Opinion\n16. In fact, the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the Iranians. - Factual\n17. What's more, the rhetoric of some members of Congress has implied that the negotiations have been between only the United States and Iran (i.e., the 47 senators' letter warning that a deal might be killed by Congress or a future president). - Factual\n18. This of course is not the case. The talks were between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (United States, United Kingdom, France, China and Russia) plus Germany, dubbed the P5+1. - Factual\n19. While the United States has played a leading role in the effort, it negotiated the terms alongside its partners. - Factual\n20. If the agreement reached by the P5+1 is rejected by Congress, it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on Iran and threaten NATO cohesion in other areas. - Opinion\n21. Another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause, after which Iran will be free to do as it pleases. - Opinion\n22. Again, this is not the case. Some of the restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities, such as uranium enrichment, will be eased or eliminated over time, as long as 15 years. - Factual\n23. But most importantly, the framework agreement includes Iran's ratification of the Additional Protocol, which allows IAEA inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared. This provision will be permanent. It does not sunset. - Factual\n24. Thus, going forward, if Iran decides to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels, monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the U.N. Security Council. - Factual\n25. Many in Congress have said that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the Senate to \"advise and consent.\" But the issue is not suited for a treaty. - Opinion\n26. Treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories. For example, the New START treaty limits Russia and the United States to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads. But any agreement with Iran will not be so balanced. - Opinion\n27. The restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on Iran. The P5+1 are obligated only to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions, which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal. - Factual\n28. Finally some insist that any agreement must address Iranian missile programs, human rights violations or support for Hamas or Hezbollah. As important as these issues are,"}

{"score": 5.0, "prediction": "1. President Barack Obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with Iran even before he became the Democratic candidate for president. - Factual\n2. Reaching a good, solid agreement with Iran is a worthy, desirable goal. - Opinion\n3. The process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations, weakening America's hand and strengthening Iran. - Opinion\n4. Obama's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with Iran that if the deal ultimately collapses, he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it. - Opinion\n5. There is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the United States and not Iran that is the more eager, even desperate, side in these talks, even though Iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions; the country whose only significant export, oil, lost more than half of its value in recent months. - Opinion\n6. The reason is that Obama has a huge political stake in these negotiations. - Opinion\n7. The President may insist that the United States will choose no deal over a bad deal, but few people truly believe he has a credible Plan B. - Opinion\n8. Few believe it, particularly in the Middle East and notably among America's Arab friends, who hold the view that Iran is running circles around the United States and outplayed Obama. - Opinion\n9. Iran is having a great Obama administration. - Opinion\n10. Saudi Arabia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes Iran has not been stopped, and there is little doubt that other countries among Iran's Muslim rivals will do the same. - Factual\n11. The notion that Obama is not handling the Iranian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and other Arabs are trying to push back against gains by Iran's allies. - Opinion\n12. We can trace it all back to the Democratic primaries in 2007, when then-Sen. Obama said he would meet Iran's leaders \"without preconditions,\" leading his rival, Hillary Clinton, to call the idea \"Irresponsible and frankly naive.\" - Factual\n13. As the years of his presidency unfolded, and the Middle East started coming apart, finding a deal with Iran started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement Obama might leave behind. - Opinion\n14. The political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace. - Opinion\n15. The framework agreement announced on Thursday came two days after Obama's March 31 deadline. - Factual\n16. The U.S.-imposed deadline served only to pressure the United States, and the French ambassador very publicly decried as a \"bad tactic.\" - Opinion\n17. That bad tactic was a political move, a push to produce some sort of result, however vague, to protect the talks from critics. - Opinion\n18. The agreement so far does not look promising. - Opinion\n19. It certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what Obama had vowed. - Opinion\n20. Nobody is talking about Iran ending its nuclear program. Not even close. - Opinion\n21. Iran will be allowed to keep one-third of its more than 6,000 centrifuges. - Factual\n22. And it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled, although Fordow will contain no nuclear materials. - Opinion\n23. Iran has insisted all along that its nuclear program has only civilian uses. The fact is that Iran has a well-established record of lying and concealing the elements of its nuclear program to U.N. inspectors. And the U.N. agency chief says that has not stopped. - Factual\n24. The negotiations' starting point is that Iran would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible -- and preferably, forever. - Opinion\n25. The world only learned about Iran's secret facilities at Arak and Natanz after dissidents raised the alarm. Iran, we have learned repeatedly, is very good at lying to international inspectors. - Opinion\n26. It is well-established that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program. - Opinion\n27.

{"score": 10.0, "prediction": "1. Five years after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and unleashed the largest marine oil spill in the nation's history, we are still experiencing -- yet only beginning to truly understand -- its profound environmental and economic repercussions. - Factual\n2. The immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented, with declines in tourism and the seafood industry, as well as the significant destruction of wildlife in the region. - Factual\n3. Since then, the amount of oil in the area has dissipated and communities have started to show signs of recovery. - Factual\n4. Reports indicate that the Gulf of Mexico's seafood industry, which supplies the United States with roughly 40% of its seafood, is finally starting to rebound. - Factual\n5. However, profound challenges remain, in part because so many questions about the long-term consequences remain unanswered. - Factual\n6. To this day, it's still unclear where all of the oil went, exactly how much remains or whether the reappearance of wildlife is a result of adaptation or a signal that the crisis is truly abating. - Factual\n7. One of the populations that can provide insight into these questions is the Gulf crab. - Factual\n8. Crabs play an important role in the region: Roughly 60 million pounds were fished in the Gulf in 2012, earning tens of millions in revenue. - Factual\n9. Yet in the aftermath of the spill, changes to crustacean communities in the area were quite apparent to the naked eye. - Factual\n10. Researchers documented substantial differences in appearance, and deformities in crabs that were affected by the spill including lesions so numerous they ate through the joints, forcing limbs to fall off. - Factual\n11. While these changes in outward appearance have dissipated in the short-term, the health of these crabs could still be precarious. - Factual\n12. I have been working with colleagues at Florida International University and University of Louisiana at Lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill. - Factual\n13. Using the power of genomics and computational biology, we analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the Macondo Prospect where the Deepwater Horizon rig was drilling when it exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab. - Factual\n14. By studying gene expression, the process that turns information from a gene into a product that functions within a cell, we searched for indicators that might signal exposure to oil and, based on the types of changes we might see, clues as to how the crabs respond. - Factual\n15. Although we are still in the early stages of our research, we are seeing significant differences in gene expression connected to exposure -- meaning the crabs are turning some genes on or off in response to oil and dispersant. - Factual\n16. We are still working to determine whether these changes impact their ability to survive and reproduce. - Factual\n17. Research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be long-term effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill. - Factual\n18. (BP's vice president of communications, Geoff Morrell, told CNN that wildlife species in the Gulf have \"bounced back and \"there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species.\") - Factual\n19. With the virtual certainty of more spills, we need a lot more information on the consequences of these disasters and how we can combat them effectively and efficiently. - Factual\n20. The U.S. Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency are making some progress. In coming months, they are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from the Deepwater Horizon spill. - Factual\n21. But government agencies cannot just rely on the short-term data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis. - Factual\n22. Instead, the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing, long-term ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what \"normal\" looks like and what factors are important in maintaining those conditions even after a disastrous oil spill. - Factual\n23. Only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources. - Factual\n\nFactuality Rating: [[10]]"}

{"score": 10.0, "prediction": "1. Mountaineers have returned to Mount Everest for this year's climbing season, resuming the quest to summit the world's highest peak after a deadly season last year. - Factual\n2. In 2014, the Nepal climbing season ended after a piece of glacial ice fell, unleashing an avalanche that killed 16 Nepalis who had just finished their morning prayers. - Factual\n3. The April 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on Mount Everest. - Factual\n4. The deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the Sherpas and the dangers of climbing Everest. - Factual\n5. In order to reduce risks, the route through Khumbu Icefall, the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed, has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer. - Factual\n6. At this point in the season, climbing teams have not yet entered Khumbu Icefall, which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving. - Factual\n7. Nepal has issued 347 permits this year to climb Mount Everest, with 125 of them from the previously shortened season, according to the Nepal Ministry of Tourism. It's a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year. - Factual\n8. The local Nepalese committee that determines the path up Everest announced in February that a different route had been selected. The climbers will now take a central route through the Khumbu Icefall, avoiding the area where the deaths occurred. - Factual\n9. The committee comprised of Sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons. - Factual\n10. The new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses, and use more vertical and horizontal ladders. - Factual\n11. But one company, Alpenglow Expeditions, said it would stop climbing from the Nepal side, where the climbers have to go through the icefall, in favor of the northern route from China. - Factual\n12. According to the China Tibet Mountaineering Association, 320 people have been registered to climb the northern route to Everest this year. That's 136 more than last year. - Factual\n13. The Chinese side of Everest has typically been less popular than its Nepal counterpart, because of concerns of government closures. - Factual\n14. Some Everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain, but it also doesn't have an icefall. - Factual\n15. The increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst Nepali companies that climbers will divert to the Chinese side. - Factual\n16.

{"score": 8.0, "prediction": "1. Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn, who remained on the job for years after becoming the highest-ranking U.S. Catholic official convicted in connection with the church's long-running sex abuse scandal, the Vatican announced Tuesday. - Factual\n2. Finn, who led the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri, was found guilty in 2012 of failure to report suspected child abuse. - Factual\n3. The case was tried by a judge instead of by jury because prosecutors wanted to protect the young victims' anonymity. - Factual\n4. Finn was convicted of one count but not a misdemeanor charge he'd also faced. - Factual\n5. He was put on two years' probation but was not forced to spend time in jail or pay a fine, according to the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. - Factual\n6. Two charges against his diocese were dropped. - Factual\n7. At the time of his conviction, Finn said, according to CNN affiliate KCTV: \"I truly regret and am sorry for the hurt these events have caused.\" - Factual\n8. Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said the conviction and penalty, which included starting a $10,000 fund for sexual abuse counseling and mandatory training for church officials on how to report abuse, would have positive ramifications. - Factual\n9. The case against Finn revolved around his diocese's dealings with Shawn Ratigan, an Independence, Missouri, priest who pleaded guilty in August 2012 to five child pornography charges. - Factual\n10. Church officials found disturbing images on Ratigan's computer but didn't notify police until nearly five months later, prosecutors said. - Factual\n11. In those interceding months, the priest kept on working. And Finn kept his job as bishop, even after his 2012 conviction. - Factual\n12. Cardinal Sean O'Malley, who took over the abuse-shaken Boston archdiocese and has become one of the Pope's point men in the United States, has acknowledged the inconsistency that someone who wouldn't be allowed to teach Sunday school was still running an American diocese. - Factual\n13. Candida Moss, a professor at Notre Dame, a Catholic university in Indiana, said it \"doesn't look very urgent\" that a decision came down only now, nearly three years after the conviction and five months after O'Malley's comments. - Opinion\n14. Several factors may have played a role in the delay, including views from lawyers or power players at the Vatican, who may be reluctant to cast blame at high-level officials who don't report allegations quickly enough to government authorities. - Opinion\n15. But the timing of the announcement may make sense given that it comes weeks after Francis came under fire for the installation of a new bishop in Chile, Juan Barros, despite protesters' claims he was complicit in sexual abuse cases there. - Opinion\n16. Now that the case has been addressed, the Kansas City-St. Joseph diocese has a new leader: Kansas Archbishop Joseph Naumann. - Factual\n17. Under the Pope's directive, Naumann will be the Kansas City diocese's apostolic administrator, in addition to his regular responsibilities in Kansas, until a permanent bishop is appointed, according to an announcement on the diocese's website. - Factual\n18. Moss, the Notre Dame professor, predicted that the shuffling at the western Missouri diocese will be \"very well received,\" though some may question why it took so long. - Opinion\n19. To that point, the co-director of BishopAccountability.org asked for more elaboration than the Vatican's one-line announcement that Francis accepted the resignation \"in accordance with ...

A 24-year-old man is in custody after he called for an ambulance, only to have French authorities come and discover weapons, ammunition and evidence of his plans to target churches -- an attack that someone in Syria requested, a top prosecutor said Wednesday. - Factual\n2. The man was identified later as Sid Ahmed Ghlam, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told television broadcaster TF1. - Factual\n3. Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said Ghlam asked for medical help at his home in Paris' 13th district Sunday morning, claiming he had accidentally injured himself when he mishandled a weapon. - Factual\n4. But authorities found more than a man with a gunshot wound in his thigh. Molins said Ghlam was someone suspected of killing a 32-year-old woman hours earlier and who then intended to launch a larger-scale terror attack in the near future. - Factual\n5. \"(He) let them believe that he was the victim,\" French President Francois Hollande said Wednesday. \"But police understood that there was an investigation that needed to be initiated.\" - Factual\n6. That probe started in earnest when police spotted traces of blood and bags in the suspect's car. Based on this discovery \"and in view of the attitude and suspicious behavior of the individual,\" they looked inside the car and found a loaded Kalashnikov gun, a 9-mm revolver, three cell phones, a laptop, a USB key, a satellite navigation system \"and handwritten documents that contained information on possible targets,\" Molins said. - Factual\n7. A search inside his home turned up yet more potentially key evidence, including three more Kalashnikovs, three bulletproof vests, police armbands, a camera, some 2,000 euros in cash and \"documents in Arabic mentioning al Qaeda and ISIS,\" according to the prosecutor. - Factual\n8. Earlier Ghlam was identified as a computer science student originally from Algeria. According to Molins, he lived in that North African country until 2001, joined his parents in France for the next two years, then went back to Algeria. He got his undergraduate degree in that nation, then returned to France to study electronics. He'd never been convicted of a crime; in fact, the lone accusation against him in August 2013 was later withdrawn. - Factual\n9. But that didn't mean French authorities didn't know about Ghlam. \"He had been noticed wishing to go to Syria,\" Molins explained. The prosecutor added that authorities found nothing to suggest he was imminent threat, \"but he was under surveillance.\" Law enforcement checked on the man once in 2014 and again this year, Cazeneuve said. - Factual\n10. The minister said the man planned to head to Syria, a country embroiled in a bloody, years-long civil war that has attracted foreigners wishing to join extremist militant groups like ISIS. There was no indication he ever made it. - Factual\n11. But, Molins said, computer searches revealed that the man had been communicating with someone in Syria who \"asked him to target a church.\" - Factual\n12. What church? Authorities didn't disclose that detail on Wednesday, though Molins did say \"this target was confirmed by (the suspect's satellite navigation system) and handwritten documents in his car.\" - Factual\n13. Assuming Ghlam doesn't walk free anytime soon -- for now, he's in custody awaiting possible charges -- that attack won't happen anytime soon. - Factual\n14. But authorities say he's already claimed at least one victim. Her name is Aurelie Chatelain. The 32-year-old was found dead Sunday morning sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car in Villejuif, killed by a single bullet that struck her shoulder, went through her body and ended up embedded in the seat. - Factual\n15. Cazeneuve said Chatelain was the mother of a 5-year-old girl and had come to the region on Saturday to attend a training class. It's not known what connection, if any, she had with the suspect. - Factual\n16. Nonetheless, Molins said that ballistics, DNA, satellite navigation and other evidence connected him to the death of Chatelain, who Molins called the region's first victim of terrorism since January. - Factual\n17. \"France, like other countries, is facing a terror threat that is unprecedented in its nature and magnitude,\" Valls said. \"...

But five years later, local officials say the city is much safer, and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to Juarez. - Factual\n4. This month the city launched the tourism campaign \"Juarez is Waiting for You.\" - Factual\n5. The rebranding effort started quietly a year ago, and on April 10, it was on full display. - Factual\n6.

A spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN that at one point, there were days when Juarez had more than 20 killings. - Factual\n17.

More than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago, but so far this year there have been 89 killings, according to Castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence. - Factual\n18. The government cleaned up corruption within the local police force, and fired or arrested a lot of bad cops who were helping the cartels. - Factual\n19. Another factor that may have helped: The turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels essentially ended, with the Sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in Juarez. - Factual\n20.

(Factual)\n- One frame in particular, No. 22, shows three black men dressed in their Sunday best, handcuffed, heads bowed standing in front of a window adorned with prison bars. The caption reads: \"Another of the social causes of the migrants' leaving was that at times they did not feel safe, or it was not the best thing to be found on the streets late at night. They were arrested on the slightest provocation.\" Lawrence painted this picture around 1940. (Factual)\n- This is important to know because there are some people who blame President Barack Obama for racial tension in America as if the March on Washington scrubbed away the lasting effects of 300 years of inequality. (Opinion)\n- No. 22 was painted before hip-hop became the pi\u00f1ata for conservative talk show hosts to bash and before sagging pants became a popular fashion statement. (Factual)\n- Some of us keep looking for a new reason why this old problem continues to haunt us because to think otherwise requires effort. (Opinion)\n- It's a lot easier to retweet a Dr. King meme. It is more convenient to say the violence began when rioters threw bricks at police and not when a city's Police Department began terrorizing its residents. (Opinion)\n- We criticize Baltimore's mayor for not \"restoring order\" as if paying victims of police brutality nearly $6 million in a four-year span is \"order.\" (Opinion)\n- Now, some people are partially blaming the 2013 movie \"The Purge\" for the uprising in Baltimore as if the 1996 riots in St. Petersburg, Florida, happened on a different planet. (Opinion)\n- Or that the more than 100 cases of Baltimore police brutality that were either lost or settled out of court since 2011 provide no insight as to what the residents have been dealing with for some time. (Opinion)\n- An 87-year-old grandmother had her shoulder broken by overzealous police, and Sen. Rand Paul -- God bless him -- suggested the rise in absentee fathers is the reason for this latest clash. (Factual)\n- It is true only 34% of black children live in a two-family household today, and I do believe that is a problem. (Opinion)\n- Soul searching, as the President suggested, is something that needs to be had by all. (Opinion)\n- But it is also true that 65% of black children lived with both parents in 1960, and yet there was still a lack of trust between the police and the minority community. (Factual)\n- Sen. Paul's rationale falls apart when you consider that John Henry Crawford III was shot and killed by police at a Walmart in Ohio while on the phone talking with the mother of his two children. (Factual)\n- In 1971, Marvin Gaye cracked the Top 10 on the pop charts with \"Inner City Blues,\" which included the lines: Crime is increasing. Trigger happy policing. Panic is spreading. God knows where we're heading. (Factual)\n- And yet so many look at the protests, uprisings and yes, sometimes riots, with this incredulous demeanor as if the raw emotions captured on camera are materializing out of thin air. (Opinion)\n- No backdrop. No historical context. Television journalists asking questions that seem to characterize the recent developments as unexplained anger detached from any tangible issue. (Opinion)\n- It is as if they believe the absence of burning crosses translated into peace and harmony. (Opinion)\n- Meanwhile, Louisiana state police want people to believe Victor White III shot himself in the chest while handcuffed sitting in the back of a police car. (Factual)\n- How can there be peace when the Department of Justice found black residents in Ferguson were preyed upon for years by a corrupt Police Department?

Gray's death last week -- from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody -- has touched off days of protests and rioting in Baltimore. - Factual\n3. Lynch's job won't be easy: As the nation's top law enforcement officer, she takes the reins of a Justice Department that has been walking a fine line between nudging local police departments in the direction of better community relations, and threatening legal action against departments where discrimination or brutality are out of control. - Factual\n4. But as events in Baltimore demonstrate, too many local departments aren't getting the message. - Factual\n5. Lynch will need to put down the carrots, pick up the stick and make clear that the Justice Department intends to crack down on police abuse by using one of its most potent weapons: the power to withhold federal funds from local departments. - Factual\n6. The first order of business will be to re-establish order in Baltimore, where the National Guard has been mobilized and a state of emergency declared. - Factual\n7. \"In the days ahead, I intend to work with leaders throughout Baltimore to ensure that we can protect the security and civil rights of all residents,\" Lynch said within hours of being sworn in on Monday. \"And I will bring the full resources of the Department of Justice to bear in protecting those under threat, investigating wrongdoing and securing an end to violence.\" - Factual\n8. A key part of that vow -- \"investigating wrongdoing\" -- must include a close look at the Baltimore Police Department, which has been the subject of bitter complaints of brutality. - Factual\n9. According to a major investigation by The Baltimore Sun published last fall, the city has paid out $5.7 million in court judgments or settlements to more than 100 people since 2011 in connection with allegations of brutality and/or violations of civil rights. - Factual\n10. Lynch has already launched a probe of the death of Freddie Gray, and the Justice Department is also investigating the recent videotaped police killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, where an officer has been arrested and charged with murder. - Factual\n11. As attorney general, Lynch has several tools with which to guide local law enforcement toward better behavior. - Factual\n12. Lynch can also apply the tougher approach of suing local departments and securing court-ordered reforms, a power conferred by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. - Factual\n13. The Obama administration has sued local departments 15 times -- more than either the Clinton or Bush administrations -- and has opened 11 more investigations of departments including those in Cleveland, Miami, and Ferguson, Missouri. - Factual\n14. But even those tough remedies may not be working, according to the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that focuses on criminal justice issues. - Factual\n15. That leaves Lynch with a final, even tougher weapon: the power, under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to deny federal law enforcement dollars to departments that engage in discriminatory practices. - Factual\n16. Lynch's predecessor as attorney general, Eric Holder, generally refrained from yanking funds, although in 2013 he did deny drug forfeiture money to the sheriff's office in Alamance County, North Carolina, claiming the department was unlawfully targeting Latinos for traffic stops. - Factual\n17. The sheriff of Alamance County sued the Justice Department and the case remains unresolved -- but it underscores the fact that Lynch has the power to press local departments, legally and financially, to curb local abuses. - Factual\n18.

{"score": 10.0, "prediction": "1. Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for \"lost\" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. - Factual\n2. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. - Factual\n3. That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. - Factual\n4. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. - Factual\n5. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. - Factual\n6. I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the \"mistake\" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. - Factual\n7. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. - Factual\n8. Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. - Factual\n9. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the \"war on women\" narrative was over. - Factual\n10. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious \"war on women\" narrative. - Factual\n11. But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. - Factual\n12. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. - Factual\n13. The \"war on women\" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. - Factual\n14. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the \"war on women\" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. - Factual\n15. The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative \"solution\" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. - Factual\n16. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. - Factual\n17.

Blue Bell decided to yank all its products after tests showed some half-gallon containers of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream contained listeria. - Factual\n10. Listeria didn't get into ice cream through the milk because Blue Bell uses pasteurized milk, Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety for Center for Science in the Public Interest, told CNN on Tuesday. - Factual\n11. But listeria could have been carried on foods like nuts that go into ice cream, she said. It can live for years on surfaces such as drains or pipes. - Factual\n12. DeWaal said the listeria probably wasn't linked to Blue Bell in 2010 because one case wouldn't spark a full investigation. Other culprits, such as cheeses and deli meats, would be considered before ice cream products, because listeria can't grow in frozen temperatures, she said. - Factual\n13. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment said three people in the state died from listeria there over the past year, possibly due to Blue Bell products. - Factual\n14. All five of the people who got sick in Kansas were patients being treated at the same hospital for unrelated causes, state health officials said. Four of them drank milkshakes at the hospital made with Blue Bell ice cream, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. It's not clear whether the fifth patient at the Kansas hospital had also consumed Blue Bell ice cream. - Factual\n15. In a separate outbreak in Texas, three patients were infected with listeria between 2011 and 2014.

{"score": 5.0, "prediction": "Explanation:\n- President Abraham Lincoln never lost his ardor for the United States to remain united during the Civil War. (Factual)\n- In his Second Inaugural address he attempted to salve the nation with an eloquent summation of his philosophy and plans for putting it into practice. (Factual)\n- \"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right,\" he orated, \"let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations' wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\" (Factual)\n- The spirit of Lincoln's second inaugural was self-evident on April 9, 1865 -- 150 years ago -- when Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee dramatically surrendered his approximately 28,000 troops to Union General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse (McLean House) in Virginia. (Factual)\n- Over 600,000 Americans -- Northerners and Southerners alike -- had perished in the bloody Civil War. (Factual)\n- But the carnage was now about to end. (Factual)\n- The historic meeting between Grant and Lee began with pleasantries about the weather and their mutual service in the Mexican War. (Factual)\n- The good fellowship was palpable. (Factual)\n- Lee, in fact, had to abruptly remind the chatty Grant about the diplomatic business at hand. (Factual)\n- After all, they were at Appomattox Courthouse to hash out terms of surrender. (Factual)\n- Grant purposely ended up being generous to Confederate soldiers. They would be paroled, not condemned to prison camps. (Factual)\n- Rebel officers were even allowed to maintain their sidearms. (Factual)\n- Personal property of Southerners would now be respected. (Factual)\n- Even rations were provided by Grant for Lee's hungry soldiers. (Factual)\n- It was Palm Sunday and in the spirit of Christian reconciliation Grant ordered that no celebration occur within Union Army ranks. (Factual)\n- \"The Confederates were now our prisoners,\" Grant wrote, \"and we did not want to exult over their downfall.\" (Factual)\n- The myth-making about Appomattox started from the moment Lee left the courthouse on his horse to travel to Richmond. (Factual)\n- Surrendering hadn't been easy for Lee. (Factual)\n- Sullen from defeat, his own family property in Arlington had been confiscated by Union forces (converted into a Union cemetery with lines of white crosses on the lawn). (Factual)\n- All 11,000 acres of his Virginia land holdings had been stripped from him by the U.S. government. (Factual)\n- With no real home, Lee rode to Richmond, depressed and destitute, rendezvousing with his sick wife Mary Curtis Lee at a spare apartment. (Factual)\n- Remarkably, the stoic Lee didn't express bitterness in public. (Factual)\n- When news reached Lee that Lincoln had been murdered, in fact, he was distraught, calling it \"a crime\" that was \"unexampled\" and \"deplorable.\" (Factual)\n- Although much remained unresolved between the victors and vanquished, the little courthouse became a symbol of unity, just like the \"Star Spangled Banner\" from the War of 1812. (Factual)\n- One post-Appomattox story that has long interested me was that of Littleberry Walker. (Factual)\n- After being present at Lee's dramatic surrender at Appomattox, Walker, a battle-fatigued Confederate, laid down his rifle and journeyed back to red-clay, Georgia, traveling mainly on foot, passing ragged clusters of Rebel amputees, many hobbling on bayonet crutches, others with arms or heads swathed in bandages and all heading in the same direction: home. (Factual)\n- Upon arriving in Atlanta, a weary Walker found the Confederate railroad-city smoldered in ruin, the handiwork of Gen. William T.
